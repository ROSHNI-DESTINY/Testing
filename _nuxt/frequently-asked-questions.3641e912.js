In cases of defective items, we'll refund you based on the current selling price, although we generally prefer exchanges for prompt resolution. Simply inform us beforehand or include a note in the return package if you prefer a refund. No more need for RMA or paperwork for return approval (though it's available on your 'My Account' page).
